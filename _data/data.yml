    assignments:
      - title: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Enabling Dynamic Pricing Policy for Charging Station Operators
        details: |
         - Focusing on the dynamic pricing policy for maximizing the long-term profits of charging station operators (CSOs).
         - Proposing a hierarchical framework to describe the economic association of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) market, which is composed of smart grid, CSOs and charging stations (CSs) serving PEVs from top to bottom. 
         - Designing a dynamic pricing policy algorithm based on multi-agent reinforcement learning to achieve higher long-term profits of CSOs.
         - The PEV charging demands are calculated based on the dataset from the National New Energy Vehicle Big Data Platform of China.
        
      - title: Dynamic Pre-Scheduling Strategy for Electric Taxi with Passenger Demand Considering
        details: |
        - Focusing on the dynamic charging pre-scheduling strategies of plug-in electric taxis (PETs), with considering not only the situations of PETs but the waiting time guarantee of PET passengers (TPs), aiming at maximizing the time-average profits of public charging stations (PCSs). 
        - Prosing a double-queue system (DQS) to describe the association of PETs, PCSs and TPs in a city.
        - Formulating a stochastic optimization problem based on the DQS to maximizing the time-average profits of PCSs
        - Designing a dynamic charging pre-scheduling algorithm based on the Lyapunov optimization technology to solve the problem.
        - The theoretical analysis and simulation based on real vehicle datasets of Beijing shows the performances and the feasibility of the proposed scheme.
